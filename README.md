🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to our Home Automation Project! This project harnesses the power of ESP32 and ESPHome to bring intelligent automation to your living space. With our system, you can control relays, monitor your environment, and seamlessly integrate everything with Home Assistant. Whether you're a home automation enthusiast or looking to optimize your home, this project is for you!

🌟 Features
Relay Control: Toggle relays manually or via Home Assistant.
Comprehensive Sensor Network: Over 20 different types of sensors to monitor various environmental factors.
Wi-Fi Connectivity: Stay connected with your home network.
OTA Updates: Easily update your firmware over the air.
Home Assistant Integration: Centralized control with Home Assistant.
🛠️ Hardware Components
Here’s what you’ll need to build your home automation system:

ESP32 Development Board
4-Channel Relay Module
Various Sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Motion, Light, etc.)
Manual On/Off Switches
Power Supply
Connecting Wires and Breadboard
💻 Software Requirements
To get started, you’ll need the following software:

ESPHome: For firmware configuration and deployment.
Home Assistant: To manage your home automation.
Python 3.x: Required for running ESPHome CLI.
Visual Studio Code: Recommended for coding and configuration.
Git: For version control.
📖 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning our project repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation-esp32.git
cd home-automation-esp32
2. Install ESPHome
If you haven't installed ESPHome yet, follow the ESPHome installation guide.

3. Flash the ESP32
Plug in your ESP32 and flash it with the firmware:

bash
Copy code
esphome run home_automation_advanced.yaml
After flashing, your ESP32 will be ready to connect to your Home Assistant setup.

4. Connect to Home Assistant
Navigate to the integrations section in Home Assistant, and you’ll see your ESP32 device ready for configuration.

5. Customize Sensor Configuration
Explore the home_automation_advanced.yaml file to activate the sensors you need. Simply uncomment the relevant sections to get started!
