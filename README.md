## Project Overview
This project aims to create an advanced home automation system using an ESP32 microcontroller and ESPHome. The system is designed to control relays via manual switches and monitor environmental parameters through various sensors. This setup allows for intelligent home automation and resource management through integration with Home Assistant.

## Features
- **Relay Control**: Control four relays manually or through Home Assistant.
- **Sensor Integration**: Monitor over 20 different types of sensors for comprehensive home automation.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Seamlessly connect to your home network.
- **OTA Updates**: Over-the-air updates to keep the firmware up-to-date.
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Full integration with Home Assistant for centralized control and monitoring.

## Hardware Components
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **4-Channel Relay Module**
- **Various Sensors** (Temperature, Humidity, Motion, Light, etc.)
- **Manual On/Off Switches**
- **Power Supply**
- **Connecting Wires and Breadboard**

## Software Requirements
- **ESPHome**: For firmware configuration and deployment.
- **Home Assistant**: For centralized home automation control.
- **Python 3.x**: For ESPHome CLI.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended IDE for coding and configuration.
- **Git**: Version control system.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation-esp32.git
cd home-automation-esp32

2. Install ESPHome
Follow the ESPHome installation guide to set up the ESPHome environment.

3. Flash the ESP32
Connect your ESP32 board to your computer and run:

bash
Copy code
esphome run home_automation_advanced.yaml
This will compile and upload the firmware to the ESP32.

4. Connect to Home Assistant
Once the ESP32 is flashed, it will appear in Home Assistant under the integrations tab. Configure it to start using your home automation setup.

5. Customize Sensor Configuration
Uncomment and configure the sensors in the home_automation_advanced.yaml file according to your requirements.
