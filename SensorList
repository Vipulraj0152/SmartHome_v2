Here’s a list of the ten sensors included in the ESPHome YAML configuration, along with brief descriptions of each:

1. DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor):
   - Description: Measures temperature and humidity. The DHT11 is less accurate and has
    a lower range compared to the DHT22, but both are widely used in home automation projects.

2. BH1750 (Light Sensor):
   - Description: Measures ambient light intensity in lux. It is useful for applications
    like adjusting lighting based on natural light availability.

3. PIR Sensor (Motion Sensor):
   - Description: Detects motion by measuring infrared light radiating from objects in 
   its field of view. Commonly used for security systems and automatic lighting.

4. MQ-2 (Gas Sensor):
   - Description: Detects combustible gases like LPG, propane, methane, alcohol, and 
   hydrogen. It is often used in gas leakage detection systems.

5. MQ-135 (Air Quality Sensor):
   - **Description: Measures the concentration of various gases like NH3, NOx, alcohol,
    benzene, smoke, and CO2. It's used for monitoring air quality.

6. Water Leak Sensor**:
   - **Description: Detects the presence of water, indicating a leak. It's typically 
   used in bathrooms, kitchens, or basements to alert users of potential flooding.

7. Soil Moisture Sensor:
   - **Description: Measures the moisture content in the soil. It's ideal for smart 
   irrigation systems to ensure plants receive the right amount of water.

8. Sound Sensor:
   - Description: Measures sound levels in the environment. It can be used to trigger 
   events based on noise levels, such as turning on lights when a certain noise threshold is reached.

9. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):
   - Description: Measures distance using ultrasonic waves. It’s commonly used for
    object detection, liquid level measurement, and proximity sensing.

10. BMP180 (Pressure Sensor):
    - Description: Measures atmospheric pressure and temperature. It is often used 
    in weather stations and altitude measurement applications.

These sensors cover a wide range of applications in home automation, from environmental 
monitoring to security and resource management. You can integrate them into your project
 based on your specific needs.
